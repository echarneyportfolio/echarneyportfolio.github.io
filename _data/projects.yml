  description: "This app, written for San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC), was my response when requested to build a \"DVD Menu\" for an instructional video series. Utilizing a basic configuration file, this Vue.js app can run online by pulling videos in from JWPlayer, or via a flash drive then pulling the videos in from the local machine. Being able to run off of a flash drive was an essential feature so that the videos could be watched in SFZC's remote mountain monastery."

  description: "Built primarily using Flask, but featuring React, webpack, Bootstrap and more, this is what is often referred to as a \"reverse commerce\" application. Instead of coming here to buy things, you sell them. The user facing portion is fairly straight-forward: you register for an account and then choose which LCD screens you want to sell to the business, once you do that a shipping label is automatically generated. The admin end (details of which are protected by an NDA) is a complex but easy to use portal for managing the entire business."
