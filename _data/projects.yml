  description: "This app, written for San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC), was my response when requested to build a \"DVD Menu\" for an instructional video series. Utilizing a basic configuration file, this Vue.js app can run online by pulling videos from JWPlayer, or via a flash drive then pulling the videos in from the local machine. Being able to run off of a flash drive was an essential feature so that the videos could be watched in SFZC's remote mountain monastery."

The admin end (details of which are protected by an NDA) is a complex but easy to use portal for managing the entire business."
